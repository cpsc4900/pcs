\subsection*{Installing the pcs\-\_\-db}

Login to your local mysql from the command line as root user, supply password, then run the \char`\"{}install\-\_\-pcs\-\_\-schema\char`\"{} script. The example below is my linux file path. Your file path will be different.

``` $>$mysql -\/u root -\/p

\begin{quotation}
supply password

\end{quotation}


mysql$>$ . /var/www/pcs/db/db\-\_\-install\-\_\-scripts/install\-\_\-schema\-\_\-v1.0.\-3.\-sql

``` Note\-: The first install should not produce any errors. As Mike edits the database, the install script needs to be updated. So, two options\-:

In the script itself insert a command to delete the old {\bfseries pcs\-\_\-db} and install a fresh new copy.

Or, we'll manually have to delete our local copy and re-\/install.

, just let us know which method to use. , make sure you change the version number of the script....easier to keep track of updates.

\paragraph*{Version Control}

{\bfseries install\-\_\-pcs\-\_\-schema\-\_\-v1.\-0.\-0}\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}* All foreign keys are integer values now.
* Only two user types created:
    - Master  password: masterpass (can access all tables)
    - Login   password: loginpass  (can only read all tables) 
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Installing \char`\"{}\-Dummy Data\char`\"{}}

Run the {\itshape dump\-\_\-data.\-sql} script to load up records to the database\-:

``` mysql$>$ . /var/www/pcs/db/db\-\_\-install\-\_\-scripts/dump\-\_\-data.sql

``` Once again, your file path will be different then mine depending on your O\-S and filesystem.
