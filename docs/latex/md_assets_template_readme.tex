\subsection*{Usage}

For now, use the templates folder as a playground and back up of code. For example, say you are working on ar\-\_\-dashboard and find a layout or functionality that would better suite the doc\-\_\-dashboard. Then, copy the code to a file here for later development.

\subsection*{Naming convetion}

Keep your name on the file. As you can see, I have a file called cb\-\_\-playgound.\-php. I'm using this to get a feel for Bootstrap layout and C\-S\-S.

\subsection*{Also Included}

Of course, this file should keep code that is constantly being reused, see php\-\_\-bootstrap.\-txt for example. This is the bare bones used to create a webpage using php and bootstrap.
