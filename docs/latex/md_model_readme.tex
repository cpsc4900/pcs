Contains reusable models.

{\bfseries Model} The model represents data and the rules that govern access to and updates of this data. In enterprise software, a model often serves as a software approximation of a real-\/world process.

Or in plain english, models will be injected into the different user's views. For example, a calendar for the A\-R user is not, in itself, a \char`\"{}view\char`\"{}, it is a model.

When it comes to javascript, we should stick to model generation as\-: (a) create function(s) to create the model, (b) have the model except a {\itshape div} id so the model knows where to put itself.

For php this is not really needed since we can do a direct \char`\"{}include\char`\"{} within the H\-T\-M\-L files.
